# Change Log
Boilerplate Angular 2 lite

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- This CHANGELOG file added to this project Boilerplate.
- Initialize webpack configuration
- Initialize readme markdown for a better explications about site

### Changed
- Refer to a "change log" instead of a "CHANGELOG" throughout the site
to differentiate between the file and the purpose of the file â€” the
logging of changes.

### Removed
- Remove empty sections from CHANGELOG, they occupy too much space and
create too much noise in the file. People will have to assume that the
missing sections were intentionally left out because they contained no
notable changes.

### Fixed
- Fix Markdown links to tag comparison URL with footnote-style links.
